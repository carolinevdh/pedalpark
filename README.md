# PedalPark

A web application providing directions to the nearest bicycle parking in San Francisco, CA

---
##Data
All data is provided by [San Francisco 311][1] through their SODA API url at `http://data.sfgov.org/resource/w969-5mn4.json`

###Finding nearest (longitude,latitude) pairs
Finding the nearest bike parking can be done by:

 1. Populating a KDTree based on the (long,lat) pair of every bike parking. For this, `scipy.spatial.KDTree` could be used, however all points would have to be converted to 3D space.
 2. Brute force traversing all bike parkings and calculating distance using the Haversine formula.
 3. **Populating a MongoDB and using its built-in [Geospatial Indexing][2]**.
